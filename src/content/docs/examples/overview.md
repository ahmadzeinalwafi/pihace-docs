Welcome to the **PIHACE Health Check Examples** section! Here, you'll find practical guides and examples on how to integrate various health checks into your system using the PIHACE library. The goal is to make it easy for you to monitor the health of your services in a clear and structured way, regardless of whether you're working with databases, APIs, or other components.

At the moment, we'll start by walking through the **Multiple Service Health Check** example. This is a basic example where we register and monitor the health of several services simultaneously. But don't worry, this is just the beginning! We're working hard to bring you more examples soon, including more advanced use cases with complex service integrations and custom setups.

### What to Expect

-   **Multiple Service Basics**: The first example will show you how to monitor multiple services like MySQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB, and HTTP endpoints in one go.

-   **More Examples Coming Soon**: Stay tuned as we continue to add more examples, including advanced features like custom health check plugins, pushing health data to external services (e.g., ElasticSearch, Prometheus), and maybe integrating with monitoring dashboards or cloud services.

So, let's get started with the basics! Read on for the **Multiple Service Health Check** example, where you can see how to get started monitoring your services with PIHACE.
