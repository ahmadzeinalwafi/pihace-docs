Welcome to **PIHACE** --- the *Python Health Check Ecosystem* --- a humble yet purposeful library designed to simplify and standardize the way health checks are performed across modern software systems. Whether you're juggling microservices, managing IoT deployments, or architecting monoliths with a sprinkle of ambition, PIHACE is here to serve as your trustworthy sidekick in ensuring your systems stay observant, resilient, and transparent.

Let's be honest: building a robust, modular, and maintainable **health check system from scratch** is no walk in the park. It starts with good intentions --- a few `ping` endpoints here, a quick DB check there --- and before you know it, you're drowning in tangled conditionals, copy-pasted scripts, and one-off integrations that refuse to play nicely with one another. Sound familiar? You're not alone.

### The Reality of DIY Health Checks

Every experienced developer has, at some point, stitched together a fragile set of ad-hoc scripts or slapped together status pages hoping they'd catch issues before users did. But health checking isn't just a "nice-to-have" anymore --- it's the **heartbeat** of every production-grade system. A system that doesn't continuously and proactively evaluate its own condition is like a pilot flying without instruments. Sooner or later, something is going to crash --- and without health checks, you'll only find out *after* it happens.

Yet crafting a good system for health checks is deceptively hard. Here are just a few of the common frustrations:

-   Repeating the same check logic across multiple projects.

-   Mixing health logic with business logic (and then regretting it).

-   Hardcoding configuration instead of keeping things declarative.

-   Forgetting to add logging, retries, or timeouts until something fails in production.

-   Realizing that your checks work... until you need to push them to a dashboard or central observability system.

That's where **PIHACE** comes in --- to take away this pain and replace it with a clear, flexible, and scalable solution.

### What is PIHACE?

PIHACE is a **modular health check toolkit** for Python, designed to help developers build structured, customizable, and consistent health check pipelines. It's not a replacement for your monitoring stack --- think of it instead as the missing link between your runtime systems and the observability platforms you already love.

At its heart, PIHACE is **plugin-driven**. Every health check is a plugin. Whether you're checking a database, verifying that an external API is up, inspecting message queue connectivity, or running a custom validation on your app state --- it's all just a plugin in PIHACE's eyes.

Plugins can be:

-   Configured via a **declarative YAML file** for environments that prefer clean ops and configuration-as-code.

-   Defined directly in **Python code** for when you need rich logic and programmatic flexibility.

This hybrid approach means you get the best of both worlds --- structure and flexibility --- without being locked into one style or one ecosystem.

### A Composable Architecture for Healthy Systems

PIHACE introduces a clear and clean modular architecture, dividing responsibilities among well-scoped components:

-   **Plugins** -- These are your actual health check routines (formerly known as "checkers"). You can think of them as diagnostic agents probing the vital signs of your system.

-   **Pushers** -- Once a result is generated, pushers help forward that result to external services such as log aggregators, tracing systems, or monitoring dashboards.

-   **Providers** -- These are optional but useful helpers that supply dynamic context, credentials, or other external inputs to plugins.

-   **Storage** -- If you want to persist your results for audits, dashboards, or long-term health analytics, storages handle that job.

This design is what allows PIHACE to be not just another health check runner, but a **framework** for system observability, readiness, and self-awareness.

### Why Health Checks Matter (More Than You Might Think)

Let's take a step back and appreciate something simple but profound: **every reliable software system is alive.** And just like all living things, it must be monitored for signs of sickness, fatigue, and failure. Health checks are your system's immune response --- the earlier you know something is off, the faster you can fix it.

In modern architectures where services are distributed, autoscaled, deployed frequently, and interconnected with fragile dependencies, knowing your system's real-time health is not just helpful --- it's **essential**.

With PIHACE, health checks become:

-   **Consistent** -- Defined in one way, reused everywhere.

-   **Readable** -- Configurations and results are both human- and machine-friendly.

-   **Portable** -- Run the same checks locally, in CI/CD, or on production nodes.

-   **Composable** -- Add new checks without breaking existing ones.

Whether you're trying to pass a liveness check in Kubernetes, running pre-deploy gates in a GitHub Actions pipeline, or just making sure your backend still connects to the database before your boss finds out it doesn't --- PIHACE helps you do it right.

### A Friendly Note Before You Begin

We understand that adopting a new tool takes trust. PIHACE doesn't try to be a magical one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, it's built with **humility**, **extensibility**, and **developer experience** in mind. We've been through the headaches of poorly designed health checks ourselves, and PIHACE is our sincere attempt to offer you something better --- a foundation you can rely on, extend as needed, and understand from the first read.

So, welcome aboard! We hope PIHACE becomes a valuable companion in your development journey --- quietly ensuring that your systems are as alive and well as they deserve to be.
