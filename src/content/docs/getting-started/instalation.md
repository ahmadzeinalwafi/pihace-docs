Installing **PIHACE** is designed to be as straightforward as possible, so you can focus on what really matters: building a robust and observable health check ecosystem for your systems.

Whether you're setting things up for a single project, integrating into a microservice pipeline, or deploying to edge devices, PIHACE offers flexible installation options that fit naturally into modern Python development workflows.

### Install via `pip`

If you're working in a virtual environment (which we humbly recommend for cleanliness), you can install the core PIHACE library using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pihace

```
That’s it! The core is now ready to use.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation, here are a few gentle reminders:

-   Ensure your Python version is ≥ 3.10.

-   Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`, `virtualenv`, or `poetry`) to isolate your project dependencies.

-   For plugin-related errors, double-check that the appropriate extra dependencies have been installed.

And of course, if something remains unclear or you hit a wall --- don't worry. You can open an [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ahmadzeinalwafi/pihace/issues), we always open to hear if something is really need to fix.
